One very likely user of this code will be third parties who want to implement games. To make this code as reusable as possible for these users, separate game-specific code from generic refereee etc. code. Maybe something like:


clsp
├── examples
│   ├── calpoker
│   ├── krunk
│   └── space_poker
└── gaming
