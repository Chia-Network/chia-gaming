; ranks are 2-14 with 14 being ace
; there are no suits, flushes, or ace-to-four straights
; takes a list of card ranks and returns the value of the best poker
; hand which can be made with them
; returned list is hand type followed by cards in descending order
; all sorting is done highest to lowest

; Hands are represented:
; 5 of a kind (5 rank)
; 4 of a kind  (4 1 quad_rank kicker)
; straight (3 3 high_card)
; full house (3 2 set_rank pair_rank)
; set (3 1 1 set_rank first_kicker second_kicker)
; two pair (2 2 1 high_pair_rank low_pair_rank kicker)
; pair (2 1 1 1 pair_rank first_kicker second_kicker third_kicker)
; high card (1 1 1 1 1 high_card first_kicker second_kicker third_kicker fourth_kicker)
