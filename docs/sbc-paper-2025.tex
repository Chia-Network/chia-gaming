\section{Introduction}
We give an explanation of an implementation of real-time gaming on top of Chia using state channels. It supports two-player, turn-based games. It enforces the game rules without requiring any trusted third party.

\subsection{Background}
TODO: Discuss the history and cite a few papers. 

\subsubsection{State Channels vs. Payment Channels}
Lightning network \cite{1} is by far the largest user of channels to date. It is a payment channel network that supports real-time payments between two counterparties who do not have a preexisting direct relationship with each other by routing through intermediaries. In order to support this, it requires pre-funding of payment channels. It does not support full-blown state channels because Bitcoin Script cannot support the complex logic required by unroll coins. State Channels are much more complex to route. 

Chia gaming does not have a static channel network. Each session is ephemeral, requiring one transaction at the start of a session to set up the channel and another one at the end to tear it down. If there is an issue in the middle of a session, the state channel is unrolled to chain, and any hands pending at that time have to play out on chain.

Routing of Chia state channels can be done, but has not been implemented yet. It has the benefit of not needing a new transaction on chain at the beginning of each session, but comes with the downsides of needing prepaid liquidity across an entire network and requires much more complex logic to implement than routed payments.

\subsubsection{The coin set model vs. the UTXO model}
The Chia on chain programming environment is a good fit for channels because it was designed from the ground up to support them, based on lessons learned from Bitcoin. The table below contains an overview of the relevant differences:


\begin{tabular}{ |p{4cm}|p{4cm}|  }
 \hline
 \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Coin Set vs. UTXO} \\
 \hline
 Bitcoin & Chia\\
 \hline\hline
 UTXO model. Only UTXOs, their sizes, spend requirements, and birthdays are stored. & Coin set model. Only things stored are coins IDs, their sizes, spend requirements, and birthdays.\\
 \hline
 UTXOs are identified using hash of transaction and index & Coins are identified using parent id and puzzle hash and size\\
 \hline
 Scriptpubkeys are passed the transaction (which includes new output creation) and either fail or accept it & Puzzles are passed solutions and return conditions which include creation of new coins\\
 \hline
 Bitcoinscript only supports simple logic and can only support covenants via hash chaining & CLVM trivially supports covenants and can implement capabilities using shells around puzzles.\\
 Signatures are required to be tied to a specific coin & Signatures can be tied to a specific coin, puzzle, or neither\\
 \hline
 Supports signature aggregation via multi-round protocol on top of sekp & Supports trivial signature aggregation using BLS\\
 \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Simple state channels with mini-eltoo}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Alice sends a partially fully funded transaction to make the state channel coin to Bob
    \item Bob adds the missing funds to that transaction, making it valid, then publishes it to the mempool. After the transaction goes through, the channel has been created and play proceeds.
    \item The state channel coin is a standard format coin which implements 2-of-2 between Alice and Bob using BLS aggregation at the signature layer
    \item Alice and Bob alternate sending half-signed unrolls of updated state to each other. The state has a sequence number which is always increased. Alice always uses even numbers and Bob always uses odd numbers. The signatures include both an unroll of the channel coin to an unroll coin and an update to an unroll coin in case an obsolete version of it is put on chain
    \item Eventually either Alice and Bob agree to a clean shutdown and sign the channel coin going directly to their payouts or one of them countersigns a state from the other one and spends the channel coin to an unroll coin
    \item An unroll coin can be spent in one of two ways: After enough time has passed it can be spent to its specified state. At any time it can be spent by a signature being presented of a higher state number of the opposite parity. Because it’s limited to two counterparties and uses parity both sides have then had a bite of the apple and there’s no need to allow multiple recursive preemptions, hence ‘mini-eltoo’.
    \item The final on chain state is generally a change coin for Alice, a change coin for Bob, and a game coin for each hand pending when the unroll happened
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Avoiding revealing/evaluating game state on chain with referee coins and slashing}

When played out on chain, a game is represented by a coin whose program contains the 'referee' program and the current state.  Players take turns spending the coin, making a new state with each spend.. The game coin optimistically accepts any move but if an illegal move is played, that allows the opponent to slash.

Referee program state (simplified):
Previous validation program hash
Last move
New validation program hash
Money split if the next player concedes
Current player’s public key
Other player’s public key

Methods by which a game coin can be spent:
Move
Takes a new validation program hash, move, and split
Must be signed by the current player’s public key
Makes a new referee coin with the specified new validation program hash, move, and split, the previous validation program hash set to this coin’s new validation program hash, and the player keys swapped
Timeout/concede
Creates two payouts, one to each player, set to their public keys
Requires a relative timelock but not signature
This is how all games end which don’t get slashed. Usually the last move specifies the split and doesn’t allow a response.
Slash
Takes a previous validation program reveal and possibly evidence
Runs the validation program passing it the new validation program hash
If the validation program fails the transaction fails. Otherwise there player to move gets a payout of all the money
Evidence can be used if, for example, a word not in the dictionary was specified. That can be proven by giving a range of words not in the dictionary and a signature of that range by the key which set up the dictionary.
Validation of earlier moves doesn’t have to be done, the end state result of them is assumed to be entirely contained in the validation program. Slashing is the one and only time any of the actual game logic is performed on chain. This results in vastly reduced on chain cost because it almost never happens.


\subsection{Designing a game for on chain play}

The requirements of state channel gaming are very stringent:
Exactly two players: Even supporting secure channels with more than two users seems very difficult. The literature around envy-free cake splitting is not encouraging.
Turn based: No timing or video game type elements can be enforced
Very few turns: When an unroll to chain occurs game play can be very slow. The fewer turns there are in the game the less opportunity for griefing. Also good for engagement.
Small moves: Moves always need to be revealed on chain and so should be as small as possible, even though only the game logichas to be revealed in the event of a slash
Simple game logic, compatible with verifying on chain: When a slash does happen the verification program for that needs to be revealed and run on chain so the validation program must be cheap and fast to run on-chain..
Randomness can be achieved using commit and reveal: Simple randomness is easy to support this way but permutations/card removal effects are difficult. More on this in the explanation of the Poker implementation

Chia gaming is rolling out with a suite of games showing the possibilities of the medium, how to do it, and exercising its edge cases:
California Poker: Similar to Chinese Poker, involves simultaneous play, the ‘reference game’.
Krunk: Similar to Wordle but one player picks a word and the other tries to guess it. Requires use of a dictionary
Space Poker: Similar to Holdem with rule changes to suit the medium. Has more complex recursive game flow than the others. Because players never make claims about their secret information which later get audited they get to keep their remaining stack when they fold early, unlike other games where premature folding has to result in getting nothing.

\subsection{Example game: Poker}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implementing mental poker as a subject of much research. The approach taken here is as follows:
    \item Alice and Bob choose their preimages. They both take turns committing to their 5th images, meaning hash(hash(hash(hash(hash(preimage)))))
    \item Alice and Bob both reveal their 4th images. Alice’s hole cards are found by hashing together her preimage and Bob’s hole cards are found by hashing together his preimage and Alice’s 4th image. If either player tries to lie about their 4th image the validation program will allow them to be slashed because the hash won’t match the 5th image commitment.
    \item There then is the preflop round of better which ends when either a player folds or both players call
    \item Both players reveal their 3rd images which are hashed together to determine the flop cards.
    \item There is the flop round of betting
    \item Both players reveal their 2nd images which are hashed together to find the turn card
    \item There is the turn round of betting
    \item Both players reveal their 1st images which are hashed together to find the river card
    \item There is the river round of betting
    \item Both players reveal their preimages to determine the winner
\end{enumerate}

An obvious problem with this approach is that there can be a duplicate card, which will happen about half the time when choosing 9 cards randomly out of 52. The simplest approach to fixing this is to play a game variant which uses an infinite deck. For the purposes of simplicity this is the approach being taken initially. Sorry not sorry.

A more conventional fix which conforms exactly to the standard rules of Texas hold 'em is: Before the hand is even started have both players choose a 5th image then do a multi-party calculation to find out if there’s a duplicate card and if so skip that hand. This is favored in many different ways. It has no impact whatsoever on on-chain play, where the costs of running programs on-chain need to be optimized. It can be done asynchronously far in advance. The form of multi-party calculation is only for two parties. It  merely needs to be able to detect when one of the participants misbehaved without having to worry about any sensitive information being detected in the process because the hidden information isn’t sensitive. 

This much more favorable approach seems to not be common in the literature because it’s centered around supporting all poker variants, which is more complex. But holdem is by far the most popular variant and the easiest to implement so it’s completely legitimate to use its special properties to make implementation easier.

Several people have claimed that this is practical on normal hardware, but no implementation has been offered and the authors attempted to try benchmarks of available libraries and the results weren’t encouraging.


\section{Peer Discovery and Connection}

Before two players can establish a State Channel, they must first find an interested peer. This is done by using a lightweight REST service.

A player, "Alice", offers a game by sending the service their desired game parameters. The service stores those parameters, and associates them with a unique, difficult to guess URL, that it sends as a response to Alice. Alice connects to a WebSocket specified by the service, and listens for messages. Later, "Bob" looks at the list of offered games, and selects the game that Alice offered. Upon game selection, Bob receives the unique URL associated with Alice's game. Bob sends a message over a WebSocket associated with the shared URL, and sends the first peer handshake message. That message is repeated to Alice, and the peer connection is established. 


\section{TLA+ Model discussion}

TLA+ \cite{2} is a formal proof system for modeling programs and systems, especially concurrent and distributed systems. The authors make use of this tool to prove that there are no states that cannot reach the "end game" state.
