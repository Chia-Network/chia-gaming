- peterson's algo potato handler.  each potato handler message should indicate whether
  subsequent to processing that, we need the potato.  there is an "interested" message
  which indicates or renews the idea that we need the potato.  We can spontaneously need
  the potato when a ui message comes in that needs to make a move.

  if we have the potato and we receive interested, it is never spuriuos.  we should either
  send the next game message our we have or do send_potato_nil.  after processing a move
  from the other side, we should look at the "subsequently need potato" flag and either
  1) send our next action if we have one or 2) do send_potato_nil.  An action is never
  withdrawn from the queue, only eventually sent so we can treat any time interested or
  "subsequent interest" is received as a call to immediate action to cause the potato
  to go to the other person.  "subsequently need potato" is set when there is another
  action in the game action queue after this one.

- shutdown state change re: bram.  shutdown after games all finished.  ok to shut down
  when a game has just started.  same party always starts.

- add short circuit for channel coin clean shutdown.

- compiler: don't use the stack for importing modules, change to a queue.

- Tell the user they don't need to export from clinc if an export shows up there.

after my turn handler is called, we get a new state and new max move size by calling the
validation program with nil evidence.

turn handler could do this if it needs.

mover share is being made the second result in a my turn handler.



## intention for state change with validation programs:

- my turn handlers get pre-sates (should be given the same state as was passed to the their
turn handler).

- you have to be given the old state in a my turn handler.
                                      
always given in all cases both my turn and their turn handler take a state and a move.
the state is always the state _before_ the move.

we store a state result from the validation program and use it on the _following_ turn.

on a their turn handler, we have an old state and a new state.  The one stored and the one
returned from the validation program just now.

- make an exception down the wire ...

a thing we should do in the referee:

 - when the validation info hash is nil, we should not check the equality of the state.

 - we've also added "validation program hash" can be nil.  that too as below i think.

 - state is purely advisory when validation_info_hash is nil.



   values associated with the game    
      state

  -----> move ----> +----------------+ 
                    | goes into my   |
                    | turn handler   |

                    +----------------+

























validation info hash and program can be nil in move.  we shouldn't compute if so.
will have to explore what that means.

today:

- change api to make state an _output_ from the validation program.  in this scenario, the
  validation program is called with nil evidence first, that produces state if slash is not
  allowed, otherwise conditions.  if slash was not allowed, we pass the state from here into
  the their turn handler, then use its evidence list for further validation program calls.

new items:

- add an "error" move result from my move handler that can return diagnostic information about
a move the handler refuses to make.

- add a list of evidences to try for a their turn handler.

items for now:

- remove timeout and gameid object from serialized version of game start (move to end, make optional)

- remove amount from params to game factory, use my contribution and their contribution instead

- stop using gnu style :-(

- figure out whether the mover share and max move size make sense passed into a my turn
  handler.

- amount / 2 new share in calpoker.

- indicate whether returning a my turn or their turn handler in game start from factory

- pass in whether i'm initiator to factory

- change amount to my_contrib vs their_contrib in factory

- add validation program hash in result to factory result

---- Slashing

calpoker_template contains pokera and pokera_hash

game start contains pokera

Handler a gives pokerb and pokerb_hash and curries handler b

pokera needs to be called with pokerb_hash as the program part of new_validation_hash

ergo: we need the outcome args when calling validation.

when alice sends a move to bob, alice needs to predict the state change bob will undergo
from bob's initial state to after alice's first move (possibly not necessarily the same state as alice has).

can grab it (ensures it's in there via prediction).
