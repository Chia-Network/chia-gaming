Outer layer responsible for handling peer connection

Constructor(launcher_coin_string (nil if they initiate), my_reward_puzzle_hash, my_stake, 
    their stake, {game_type: game_factory})

game_factory takes amount and whether_I_initiated and parameters and returns 
    (my_contribution, [game_info_my_turn], [game_info_their_turn])

game_info_my_turn is
    (id, my_turn_game_handler, validation_info_hash, move, max_move_size, mover_share)
game_info_their_turn is
    (id, their_turn_game_handler, validation_program, 
    validation_program_hash, state, move, max_move_size, mover_share)

    The receiving side has to have been given warning of the other side initiating before this
    is received so it has the appropriate arguments. Those must happen in order and may be queued up.
